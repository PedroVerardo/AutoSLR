# Project introduction

The primary objective of this project is to minimize rework, assist new computer science researchers, and ensure the centralization of tools. To achieve this, we will utilize various programming tools not to fully automate the process but to streamline the steps required to complete a systematic literature review(SLR). Additionally, we will provide containerized microservices for deployment in a backend system.

# How to run it

## Clone the repository

## Pip the requirement pakages
    pip install -r requirements.txt

## Run the docker compose file
    sudo docker compose -f "dockercompose.yml" up
*Obs: you can change that to remove some components without breaking the system*
