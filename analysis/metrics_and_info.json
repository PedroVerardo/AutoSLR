        "text_example": "The preliminary analysis entails choosing an acceptable sample strategy because the dataset is severely imbalanced. Using some technique, such as changing the amount of the original data, sampling methods will convert an imbalanced dataset into a balanced distribution. The difficulty with imbalanced datasets is that most machine learning approaches will disregard the minority class, which is fraud, and hence perform poorly on it. Undersampling, Oversampling, and ROSE sampling approaches were tested for this objective. The performance of each sampling technique on the dataset is measured using ROC-AUC performance measure. The ROC-AUC gives you a number between 0 and 1, with one being the best and 0 being the worst. We chose the sampling approach with the maximum area under the curve (AUC) based on the study of the three sample methods since it will deliver the best performance. For our dataset, oversampling produced the greatest AUC.",
