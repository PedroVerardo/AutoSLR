        "text_example": "The preliminary analysis entails choosing an acceptable sample strategy because the dataset is severely imbalanced. Using some technique, such as changing the amount of the original data, sampling methods will convert an imbalanced dataset into a balanced distribution. The difficulty with imbalanced datasets is that most machine learning approaches will disregard the minority class, which is fraud, and hence perform poorly on it. Undersampling, Oversampling, and ROSE sampling approaches were tested for this objective. The performance of each sampling technique on the dataset is measured using ROC-AUC performance measure. The ROC-AUC gives you a number between 0 and 1, with one being the best and 0 being the worst. We chose the sampling approach with the maximum area under the curve (AUC) based on the study of the three sample methods since it will deliver the best performance. For our dataset, oversampling produced the greatest AUC.",

The classification systems demonstrate the structure and nature of the classification tasks involving both digits and letters, and additionally provides benchmark results for this new dataset. The purpose of the EMNIST dataset is to function as a drop- in replacement for the MNIST dataset in existing classification systems. As a result, the focus of the methodology is on reproducing the steps used to convert the NIST dataset into the MNIST dataset and apply them to the entire NIST SpecialDatabase 19. This conversion process and the modifications implemented to better convert the letters is described in Section II-B. The classifier used in this work are introduced and described in Section II-C and were applied to three different classifi- cation tasks based on combinations of letters, digits and the full classification task using the NIST dataset. In addition, a subset of the EMNIST digits were extracted and used to train a classifier. The results were then compared to an identical network applied to the MNIST digits in order to explore and validate the conversion process used in this work. The code used to extract the data from the original NIST dataset, the conversion code from 128 × 128 pixel binary images to the converted gray-scale and the code to perform the training and testing splits are provided as supplementary material to this paper.",
